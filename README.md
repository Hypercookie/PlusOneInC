# PlusOneInC
Can you add one to a number without using anything but #define ?

Yes you can. 

The above code uses nothing but macros to add +1 to any number with 9 or less digits. (It can also decrement)<br />
Some of it is taken from [this amazing blog](https://github.com/pfultz2/Cloak/wiki/C-Preprocessor-tricks,-tips,-and-idioms), but most of it is just pain.
